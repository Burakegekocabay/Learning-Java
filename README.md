# Learning-Java
Learning java with project based learning system.  (from beginner) <br>
Try to solve question in Readme.MD file according to Algorithm. <br>
Then go to Project and check your answer from source code.

# <a href="https://github.com/Burakegekocabay/Learning-Java/tree/main/01-Reaching%20the%20digits"> 01 - Reaching the digits (Separate digits)</a>
 <h3>Algorithm</h2> 
-Take 2-digit input with Scanner. <br>
-Separate into digits <br>
-Print the digits. <br>
 <h3> Output </h3> 
Enter a 2-digit number : 75(input) <br> 
Digits are 7 and 5.
<br>

# <a href="https://github.com/Burakegekocabay/Learning-Java/tree/main/02-Converting%20Temperatures"> 02 - Converting Temperatures</a>
 <h3>Algorithm</h2>
Write a program that converts a Fahrenheit degree to Celsius <br>
-Take input for Fahrenheit <br>
-Use the mathematics expression to convert  <br> 
-Print the Celsius  <br>
<h3> Output </h3>
Enter the Fahrenheit: 56(input) <br>
56 Fahrenheit equals 13.333 Celsius
<br>

# <a href="https://github.com/Burakegekocabay/Learning-Java/tree/main/03-Usage%20of%20If-else"> 03 - Usage of If-else </a>
 <h3>Algorithm</h2>
The program randomly generates two single-digit integers 
number1 and number2 and displays a question such as “What is 7 + 
9?” to the student. After the student types the answer, the program 
displays a message to indicate whether the answer is true or false
<br>
<h3> Output </h3>
What is 5 + 1? (random) <br>
6(input)<br>
Answer is True. <br>
///////<br>
What is 6+1? (random)<br>
9(input)<br>
Answer is False.
<br>

#  04 -  Leap Year(Usage of Operators : && || ) 
 <h3>Algorithm</h2>
This program first prompts the user to enter a year as an int value 
and checks if it is a leap year. <br>
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is 
divisible by 400.
<br>
<h3> Output </h3>
Enter a year: 2024(input)<br>
2024 is a leap year.<br>
///////<br>
Enter a year: 2000(input)<br>
2000 is not a leap year.
<br>

# 05 - Usage of For Loop
 <h3>Algorithm</h2>
Type 100 times "I'm learning java" with for loop. <br>
<h3> Output </h3>
I'm learning java <br>
I'm learning java <br>
I'm learning java <br>
. <br>
.<br>
I'm learning java 
<br>

# 06 - Guess Number(Usage of While Loop) 
<h3>Algorithm</h2>
Write a program that randomly generates an integer between 0 and 
100, inclusive. The program prompts the user to enter a number 
continuously until the number matches the randomly generated 
number. For each user input, the program tells the user whether the 
input is too low or too high, so the user can choose the next input 
intelligently.
<h3> Output </h3>
I hold a number guess it.<br>
64(input) <br>
go up <br>
80(input) <br>
go down <br>
75(input) <br>
You found number.
