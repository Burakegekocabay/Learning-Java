# <a href="https://github.com/Burakegekocabay/Learning-Java/tree/main/06-Guess%20Number"> 06 - Guess Number(Usage of Do-While Loop)</a> 
<h3>Problem</h3>
Write a program that randomly generates an integer between 0 and 
100, inclusive. The program prompts the user to enter a number 
continuously until the number matches the randomly generated 
number. For each user input, the program tells the user whether the 
input is too low or too high, so the user can choose the next input 
intelligently.
<h3> Output </h3>
I hold a number guess it.<br>
64(input) <br>
go up <br>
80(input) <br>
go down <br>
75(input) <br>
You found number.

# <a href= "https://github.com/Burakegekocabay/Learning-Java/tree/main/07-%20Palindrome%20Words"> 07 - Palindrome Words </a> 
<h3>Problem</h3>
A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward. The words “mom,” “dad,” and “noon,” for instance, are all palindromes.
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
Solution is to check whether 
the first character in the string is the same as the last character. If so, check whether the second character is the same as the second-to-last character. This process continues until a mismatch is found or all the characters in the string are checked
<h3> Output </h3>
Enter a word: radar(input) <br>
radar is a palindrome word. <br>
///////<br>
Enter a word: test(input) <br>
test is not a palindrome word.
<br>

# <a href="https://github.com/Burakegekocabay/Learning-Java/tree/main/08-Prime%20Numbers"> 08 - Prime Numbers </a>
<h3>Problem</h3>
Write a program that displays the first 50 prime numbers 
in five lines, each of which contains 10 numbers. 
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
An integer greater 
than 1 is prime if its only positive divisor is 1 or itself. For example, 
2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime numbers, but 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not
<br>
If a number is not divisible by any number preceding it (except 1) without remainder, it is a prime number. For example, 5 is not equally divisible by 4, 3, or 2, so 5 is a prime number
<h3> Output </h3>
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 <br>
31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 <br>
