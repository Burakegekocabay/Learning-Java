 <h3> Output </h3> 
Enter a 2-digit number : 75(input) <br> 
Digits are 7 and 5.
<br>

# <a href="https://github.com/Burakegekocabay/Learning-Java/tree/main/02-Converting%20Temperatures"> 02 - Converting Temperatures</a>

<br>

# <a href="https://github.com/Burakegekocabay/Learning-Java/tree/main/03-Usage%20of%20If-else"> 03 - Usage of If-else </a>
 <h3>Algorithm</h3>
The program randomly generates two single-digit integers 
number1 and number2 and displays a question such as “What is 7 + 
9?” to the student. After the student types the answer, the program 
displays a message to indicate whether the answer is true or false
<br>
<h3> Output </h3>
What is 5 + 1? (random) <br>
6(input)<br>
Answer is True. <br>
///////<br>
What is 6+1? (random)<br>
9(input)<br>
Answer is False.
<br>

# <a href="https://github.com/Burakegekocabay/Learning-Java/tree/main/04-Leap%20Year"> 04 -  Leap Year(Usage of Operators : && || ) </a>
 <h3>Algorithm</h3>
This program first prompts the user to enter a year as an int value 
and checks if it is a leap year. <br>
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is 
divisible by 400.
<br>
<h3> Output </h3>
Enter a year: 2024(input)<br>
2024 is a leap year.<br>
///////<br>
Enter a year: 2000(input)<br>
2000 is not a leap year.
<br>

# <a href="https://github.com/Burakegekocabay/Learning-Java/tree/main/05-Usage%20of%20For%20Loop"> 05 - Usage of For Loop </a>
 <h3>Algorithm</h3>
Type 100 times "I'm learning java" with for loop. <br>
<h3> Output </h3>
I'm learning java <br>
I'm learning java <br>
I'm learning java <br>
. <br>
.<br>
I'm learning java 
<br>

# <a href="https://github.com/Burakegekocabay/Learning-Java/tree/main/06-Guess%20Number"> 06 - Guess Number(Usage of Do-While Loop)</a> 
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
Write a program that randomly generates an integer between 0 and 
100, inclusive. The program prompts the user to enter a number 
continuously until the number matches the randomly generated 
number. For each user input, the program tells the user whether the 
input is too low or too high, so the user can choose the next input 
intelligently.
<h3> Output </h3>
I hold a number guess it.<br>
64(input) <br>
go up <br>
80(input) <br>
go down <br>
75(input) <br>
You found number.
<br>   

# <a href= "https://github.com/Burakegekocabay/Learning-Java/tree/main/07-%20Palindrome%20Words"> 07 - Palindrome Words </a> 
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward. The words “mom,” “dad,” and “noon,” for instance, are all palindromes.
<br>
Solution is to check whether 
the first character in the string is the same as the last character. If so, check whether the second character is the same as the second-to-last character. This process continues until a mismatch is found or all the characters in the string are checked
<h3> Output </h3>
Enter a word: radar(input) <br>
radar is a palindrome word. <br>
///////<br>
Enter a word: test(input) <br>
test is not a palindrome word.
<br>

# <a href="https://github.com/Burakegekocabay/Learning-Java/tree/main/08-Prime%20Numbers"> 08 - Prime Numbers </a>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
Write a program that displays the first 50 prime numbers 
in five lines, each of which contains 10 numbers. An integer greater 
than 1 is prime if its only positive divisor is 1 or itself. For example, 
2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime numbers, but 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not
<br>
If a number is not divisible by any number preceding it (except 1) without remainder, it is a prime number. For example, 5 is not equally divisible by 4, 3, or 2, so 5 is a prime number
<h3> Output </h3>
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 <br>
31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 <br>
73 79 83 89 97 101 103 107 109 113 <br>
127 131 137 139 149 151 157 163 167 173 <br>
179 181 191 193 197 199 211 223 227 229
<br>

# 09 - Usage of Arrays
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
Read 50 numbers, store it in an integer array. compute their average, 
and find out how many numbers are above the average.
<h3> Output </h3>
Number 1: 24(input) <br>
Number 2: 56(input) <br>
. <br>
. <br>
Number 50: 72(input)<br>
<br>
Average: 62.2 <br>
15 number are above the average.
